          Review of <a href="https://uxmag.com/articles/is-there-a-stranger-thing-than-your-brain-on-virtual-reality">"Is there a 
          Stranger Thing than Your Brain on Virtual Reality?"</a>, by Caitlin Burke.
          <br><br>
          Caitlin Burke wrote an article about the emerging technology of virtual reality and how user experience designers need to 
          be aware of the unique, counterintuitive approach that must be adapted to successfully design a virtual experience. Typically 
          UX designers are trying to make a user think as little as possible; they want the user to always know where they are in an 
          application and what they should do next to get the action they want performed with as little thinking as possible. But in 
          the case of virtual reality, an ideal experience would be quite the opposite: the user should feel lost, curious, amazed. They 
          are not just pressing buttons and scanning a screen, they are being immersed into an experience.
          <br><br>
          Burke outlines the little-known history of virtual reality, pointing out that this desire for a different kind of experience 
          isn't anything new and developers have been slowly realizing how different this sort of technology is. In the 1950s there was 
          the "Sensorama", where people would view movies with smells and movements incorporated into their space. In the 1960s the 
          "Sword of Damocles" allowed people to control their experience with their physical movements. As virtual reality progressed, 
          there was less emphasis on the user's outer senses and more emphasis on simply presenting them with a virtual world and 
          manipulating their minds, or "suspending disbelief" as Burke puts it, to fully immerse themselves in the experience.
          <br><br>
          Burke presents interesting neuroscientific examples of how the hippocampal region of the brain specifically responds differently 
          in real and virtual environments. In real environments, cells fire systematically; the hippocampus is successfully mapping the 
          environment. In virtual environments, the cells fire randomly. Burke argues that we should be focusing and capitalizing on this 
          research and developers of virtual reality should want to make the user lose their sense of time and place, in order to create a 
          more exciting and surreal experience.
          <br><br>
          It's very beneficial for UX designers to be aware that one approach will not suit all types of technology. I also believe 
          utilizing data from scientific studies on the mind could alter the field of UX design for the better. The studies and ideas 
          presented by Burke are just a small introduction to everything that I think should be considered for designing for virtual 
          reality. While immersing the user so that they lose sense of time and place is an important and exciting facet of some 
          virtual reality, there might be instances where we need to figure out how to provide that sense of full immersion while 
          still allowing the user to feel comfortable in and navigate through the virtual reality -- a "sublime" experience must still 
          maintain aspects of good functionality.
