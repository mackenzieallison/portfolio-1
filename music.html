          <strong>What is this?</strong><br>
          A music application I designed independently for COGS 187A: Usability & Information Architecture.<br><br>
          
          <strong>The Process</strong><br>
          Interviews | Comparisons | Competitive Analysis | Design<br><br>
          I interviewed various people on the music application of their choice. I inquired about the playlists they create, 
          their favorite things about the application, and any problems they have experienced with it. I got valuable insight 
          into the individual thought processes behind creating playlists, what attracts people to a certain app, and what 
          features (or lack of) in an application can end up being a problem. Specifically, I found that convenience is a very 
          large factor in what application people choose to use -- the application that comes with the phone has a definite leg 
          up. The next biggest factor was the number of features offered. Users particularly enjoyed applications that offered 
          them everything they could possibly want, allowing a varied musical experience. Small details tended to be a big issue 
          with users; applications that didn't constantly allow them a way to keep track of what they were doing and undo mistakes 
          ended up causing frustration.<br><br>
          I compared the three applications that were used among my pool of interviewees. I examined how a user would go about 
          performing three specific scenarios on each application: creating a playlist, managing a playlist, and searching for 
          music. The best applications had a conventional and therefore intuitive process that made multiple actions available in 
          one place.<br><br>
          My competitive analysis compared the navigational structures of the three applications: What categories were listed on the 
          icon bar? Where did each of those categories lead to? Additionally, I compared the "Genres" offered by each application. 
          This allowed an interesting analysis of not only what subcategories each application chose to include, but the vocabulary 
          used in their lists. I found that while all of the applications had clearly labelled sections on their main navigation bar, 
          the sections thereafter lacked order or consistency, and were sometimes just startlingly random.<br><br>
          I designed my application with the goal of creating something modern and appealing, but also intuitive and easy to get from 
          section to section and perform or abort actions. The defining design decisions of my project are as follows:<br>
          <strong>1. The Icon Bar</strong><br>
          First, I compared the icon bars of the three apps I had been analyzing and comparing for this project. They all had “Library” 
          and “Browse” sections. Apple Music and Spotify had “Radio” and “Search” sections (whereas Google Play had a search icon at 
          the top right). Spotify and Google Play both had “Home” sections. I immediately decided I wanted to do what Apple Music did 
          and have the “Library” page function as the starting homepage as well. The separate “Home” sections on Spotify and Google 
          Play had unclear purposes; they just had a ton of random sections and recommendations. Having the user’s library function 
          as the homepage is much more straightforward and useful -- more often than not, that is probably the section the user is 
          opening the app to get to.<br>
          Second, I decided to try and simplify the icon bar as much as possible. Instead of emulating Apple Music and having a 
          “For You” section for recommendations and a “Browse” section for discovering new music, I combined both of those ideas into 
          a “Discover” section where the user can browse for new music based on a specific genre or what’s trending now, or browse for 
          new music based on what’s in their library. Having a section for both of those things also accomplished what Spotify and 
          Google Play had separate “Home” pages for.<br>
          Since I chose to not include a radio feature in my app at all, I ended up with a very simple icon bar: Library, Search, and 
          Discover. With just these three main pages/shortcuts, the user is able to accomplish any task available on the app with the 
          least amount of clicking and thinking.<br>
          <strong>2. Back Buttons</strong><br>
          Since some tasks involve a user to click through multiple pages, I wanted them to always have the option of going back to a 
          previous page, as opposed to having to exit out of the process completely by having to choose one of the main pages on the 
          icon bar.<br>
          All of the “child pages” have a back button in the top left corner, regardless of whether they are a part of an entire 
          process (e.g., creating a playlist) or their own page (e.g., searching for music). This keeps their experience on a clear 
          linear path that goes in both directions, with the option of exiting completely and back to a main page also always 
          available via the icon bar.<br><br>
          <strong>3. Color Scheme</strong><br>
          I wanted the app to have a consistent color scheme throughout. I chose to forego a plain white background because it would 
          be bland and the app would be lacking in an “identity”. When the user opens up the app, I want them to immediately see the 
          color scheme and make an association with the app. This not only initiates a deeper impression on a new user but it allows 
          them to quickly recognize the app when they are scrolling through apps they have open.<br>
          I chose a background that wasn’t busy but still had some semblance of a design. The use of three-dimensionality and the 
          colors black and red give it a sleek and modern look, which is a popular trend among technology today.
