          <strong>What is this?</strong><br>
          A mobile application I designed with a team as a quarter-long final project for COGS 120: Interaction Design.<br><br>
          
          <strong>Why did we create this?</strong><br>
          College students are required to utilize many different platforms to check announcements, assignments, grades, and class
          resources. To complicate things even more, different classes use different combinations of platforms. We realized students
          need one mobile-friendly platform that integrates all of these things and eliminates having to open multiple tabs or 
          applications and remember which website is used for what in which class. (We were often asked how the app would get all of
          this information. The answer to that is there would either be a version for professors to use, which would require a lot of
          marketing, advertising, outreach, etc. to have it take off, or the app would be able to sync to the various platforms that
          are used and extract information. This was beyond the scope of the assignment though, since we were only focused on the 
          design, not the mechanics).<br><br>
          
          <strong>How did we create this?</strong><br>
          We began by deciding the most necessary components, which would make up the navigation bar present on each page. We then
          decided what would be the most useful information to see immediately, which would make up the homepage. These decisions
          were made through both analyzing various apps and websites of similar themes and through user interviews. The defining 
          principles of our app were simplicity and efficiency. We were constantly adding and subtracting information on each page, 
          focusing on the delicate balance of giving the user everything they would need without overwhelming them and cluttering the
          app. Additionally, we wanted everything, from the icons to the headers, to be self-explanatory; users should be able to 
          understand exactly what it is the moment they see it. After a lot of user testing, we were able to finally settle on the most 
          useful and intuitive design.
